# Thomas Baker
**Quantitative Researcher (MSc) & Data Engineer | Financial ML & High-Integrity Pipelines**

I am a Data Engineer and Quantitative Researcher specializing in building auditable, scalable data infrastructure and machine learning models for financial systems. My work bridges the gap between raw data ingestion and actionable financial insights, with a focus on market regime detection, automated financial workflows, and high-frequency analytics.

Currently, I work as a Data Engineer at **Rocket Lawyer**, controlling the development of ML infrastructure and rigorous A/B testing frameworks, while completing my MSc in Data Science & AI (Distinction Track).

## 🔧 Core Competencies

* **Financial Engineering:** Market regime detection (HMM/GMM), non-stationary time-series analysis, and custom loss function design (Directional Big Error) for P&L optimization.
* **Data Infrastructure:** Designing Medallion architectures (Bronze/Silver/Gold) on Snowflake and building low-latency analytics suites using Streamlit.
* **AI Automation:** Developing agentic workflows for Accounts Payable/Receivable automation, invoice auditing, and risk mitigation.
* **Statistical Rigor:** Implementing hypothesis testing, power analysis, and cohort sizing to ensure data integrity in decision-making.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### Market Regime Detection & Signal Stability (MSc Research)
* **Focus:** Quantitative Finance / Machine Learning
* Developed a "stacked" machine learning architecture using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to detect latent market regimes in equity data.
* Engineered a custom **Directional Big Error (DBE)** loss function to prioritize profitability and directional accuracy over standard statistical error metrics.
* Built a robust backtesting framework to validate signal stability against non-stationary market conditions.

### AI Finance Agent (Invoice & Audit Automation)
* **Focus:** FinTech / Agentic AI
* Architected an autonomous agent capable of auditing invoices for deficiency (e.g., missing PO numbers) and validating against a mock ERP system (Microsoft Dynamics simulation).
* Implemented "Human-in-the-loop" logic to draft professional correspondence for vendors regarding compliance issues, significantly reducing manual Accounts Payable workload.

### Inbox0: Enterprise Message Architecture
* **Focus:** Scalable Systems / Nx Monorepo
* Built a complex monorepo architecture (Next.js, Fastify, PostgreSQL) to automate high-volume email analysis and routing via the Gmail and Twilio APIs.
* Focused on security and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) to simulate enterprise-grade deployment environments.
