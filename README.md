# Hi, I’m Tom Baker

I'm a data scientist-in-training with a background in web development and a strong interest in AI, machine learning, and prompt engineering. Currently studying for my MSc in Data Science & AI at Birkbeck, I enjoy building practical tools that solve real-world problems—especially in education and automation.

## What I’m Working On

- LLM-powered educator tools: Building a Streamlit app for prompt generation, task planning, and document summarisation.
- Machine Learning projects: Supervised learning (classification, regression), SVMs, PCA, CNNs.
- Prompt experimentation: Designing and evaluating prompt strategies (role-based, chain-of-thought, few-shot).
- Web-based learning tools: Developing interactive revision and quiz systems using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
